C. <<>>Technical Background<<>>
I started programming in Middle School with Roblox (so Lua Code) and learned that I loved it and have a knack for it. This moved into me finding programming groups and growing relationships to cultivate a culture in a community that I found similar interests with. I've always thought that this was the route that I asupposed to go down.
